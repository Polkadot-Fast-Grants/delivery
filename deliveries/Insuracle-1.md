**The delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/Polkadot-Fast-Grants/delivery/blob/master/delivery-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** https://github.com/danielabrahamx/apply
* **Milestone Number:**  1
* **DOT Payment Address:** Polkadot Asset Hub wallet address: 14KjvUGLgres227Ziay5KFQ8kQv2szikbTEHWVtEJZ1dZLgh

**Context** (optional)
> This milestone delivers the foundational components of Insuracle, a parametric insurance platform built on Polkadot. The deliverables include the core smart contracts for flood insurance policies, comprehensive documentation and testing infrastructure, and an introductory article explaining the project's concept and achievements. These components establish the MVP foundation for automated, transparent insurance policies triggered by verifiable oracle data, specifically focusing on flood events monitored through government database.

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work.
> 
> Remember that milestone payments are capped at $5,000 USD and must be delivered within 3 months of approval.
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.

**Additional Information**
> Any further comments on the milestone that you would like to share with us.
> Testing Verification:
All deliverables have been thoroughly tested and can be verified by following the testing guide. The contracts demonstrate full functionality for policy creation, state management, and mock payout scenarios as specified in the original grant application.
> Future Development:
Following this milestone, we plan to continue development with Milestone 2, which will include the frontend dApp and full oracle integration. The foundation established in this delivery provides a solid base for expanding to additional parametric insurance products and eventual mainnet deployment.
