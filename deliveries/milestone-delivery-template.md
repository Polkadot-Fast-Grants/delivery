# Milestone Delivery ðŸ“¬

> âš¡ Only the GitHub account that submitted the application is allowed to submit milestones. 
> 
> Don't remove any of the mandatory parts presented in bold letters or as headlines! Lines starting with `>`, such as this one, can be removed.

**The delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/Polkadot-Fast-Grants/delivery/blob/master/delivery-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** Please provide a link to your merged application (the `.md` file in the [applications](https://github.com/Polkadot-Fast-Grants/apply/tree/master/applications) directory).
* **Milestone Number:** e.g. 1
* **DOT Payment Address:** Please provide the payment beneficiary address on Polkadot Hub.

**Context** (optional)
> Please provide a short paragraph or two connecting the deliverables in this milestone and describing their purpose.

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work.
> 
> Remember that milestone payments are capped at $5,000 USD and must be delivered within 3 months of approval.
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.

| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| 1. | ... |...| ...| 
| 2.  | ... |...| ...| 

**Additional Information**
> Any further comments on the milestone that you would like to share with us.
>
> Note: After submission, your milestone will be evaluated within 14 days. If changes are needed, you will have one opportunity to fix and resubmit within 14 days.
