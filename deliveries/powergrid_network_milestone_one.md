**Context**

PowerGrid Network Milestone 1 delivers the core smart contract infrastructure for our decentralized virtual power plant solution on Polkadot. This milestone establishes the fundamental blockchain layer that enables device registration, grid event coordination, token-based rewards, and decentralized governance. These smart contracts form the foundation for coordinating thousands of smart home devices to provide grid services while incentivizing user participation through our $PWGD token economy.

The delivered contracts create a complete ecosystem where homeowners can register their energy devices, participate in demand response events, earn rewards for grid services, and participate in network governance - all built on Polkadot's secure and scalable infrastructure.

   - Configurable quorum requirements and voting periods
   - Parameter update capabilities for network management
   - Complete governance lifecycle implementation

**Integration Test Validation**

The milestone includes **comprehensive integration tests** that validate the complete user journey as requested by community feedback:

1. **`test_complete_user_journey()`** - Validates all 5 steps of the user flow:
   - âœ… User registers device in ResourceRegistry with stake
   - âœ… Admin creates grid event in GridService 
   - âœ… User participates in grid event with energy contribution
   - âœ… Participation verified and rewards distributed via Token contract
   - âœ… User stakes tokens and participates in governance

2. **`test_data_flow_integration()`** - Tests complete data flow across all contracts
3. **`test_error_handling_integration()`** - Validates error scenarios across the system
4. **`test_scalability_integration()`** - Tests system scalability with multiple users/events
5. **`test_cross_contract_integration()`** - Verifies cross-contract interactions and state consistency

**Run integration tests with:**
```bash
cd contracts/integration-tests
cargo test --verbose
```


**Additional Information**

**Development Status**: Milestone 1 is complete and production-ready. All smart contracts have been built, tested, and optimized for deployment. The codebase includes comprehensive documentation, automated testing, deployment scripts, and **real integration tests** that validate the complete user journey without placeholder assertions.

**Community Feedback Integration**: The integration tests directly address community feedback requesting validation of the complete user journey. The `test_complete_user_journey()` function provides concrete proof that all contract interactions work together as designed.

**Next Steps**: Milestone 2 will focus on smart device integration, connecting real hardware (smart plugs/sensors) to the blockchain infrastructure delivered in Milestone 1.

**Repository Status**: The main branch contains the complete Milestone 1 deliverables with commit hash representing the final delivery state including integration tests.

**Testing**: All 19 tests pass successfully (14 unit + 5 integration), covering device registration, grid event participation, token operations, governance workflows, and complete user journey validation. The test suite can be executed with `./scripts/test-all.sh` in the repository root.

**Build System**: Complete build automation is provided with optimized WASM compilation, comprehensive error handling, and development environment setup scripts.

## ðŸ”¬ How to Test Milestone 1

To reproduce the results of Milestone 1 on a clean Linux environment:

1. **Run setup script** (installs Rust, wasm target, cargo-contract v5.0.1, substrate-contracts-node):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```

2. **Start a local Substrate contracts node** in a separate terminal:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run-node.sh
   ```

3. **Build all contracts**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build-all.sh
   ```

4. **Run all unit and integration tests**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-all.sh
   ```

5. **Run integration tests**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-integration.sh
   ```

If all steps succeed, you should see:
- Optimized WASM artifacts generated in `target/ink/<contract_name>/`
- âœ… Build success messages for each contract
- âœ… Test results showing all 14 unit tests and 5 integration tests passing
